# WKP6 - Hungry Student Restaurant

## Code structure.

First, I grabbed all the elements that I might need during the time that I am coding. Second, I generated the object into HTML by looping through it using map() method and created an HTML string and also used ${} to access the information from the object and add it to DOM. Created several function that deal with checkboxes. After that I created the modal.

## About improvement.

If I had more time I would figure out why do my checkboxes did't work as I expected it to be and worked out how to get the order list in the right side.

## Something that I learned.

There weren't really new things in this project, all the technics that we should use in this project are technics that we have seen like event delegation, generate object into HTML, use of map(), filter() and reduce() and also creating modal so I don't know what is the new thing there.

## Challenge.

For me, the most challenging part was showing the result of the checkboxes after filtering them which I could figure out how to deal with that even if I tried.

## More explanation.

I need more explanation about the checkboxes and to get the times (*2 or *6) for example.

## Comments.

I could deal with lots of things this time, I focused with one thing at a time and I spent most of my time to figure out my problem with the checkboxes.
